\section{Introduction}
This document provides a PRISMA 2020 Flow Diagram for systematic reviews. Modify the values in the \textbf{Variables Section} to update the flowchart dynamically.

% Identification Phase
\prismaflownode{n1a}{left=of tc}{Records identified through database searching (n = \recordsIdentified)}{};
\prismaflownode{n1b}{right=of tc}{Additional records identified through other sources (n = \otherSources)}{};
\prismaflownode{n2}{below=of tc |- n1a.south}{Records after duplicates removed (n = \afterDuplicates)}{n1a};
\prismaflowarrow{n1b}{n2}; % Arrow connecting sources to filtered records

% Screening Phase
\prismaflownode{n3}{below=of n2}{Records screened (n = \recordsScreened)}{n2};
\prismaflownode{n3r}{right=of n3}{Records excluded (n = \recordsExcluded)}{};
\prismaflowarrow{n3}{n3r};

% Eligibility Phase
\prismaflownode{n4}{below=of n3}{Full-text articles assessed for eligibility (n = \fullTextAssessed)}{n3};
\prismaflownode{n4r}{right=of n4}{Full-text articles excluded, with reasons (n = \fullTextExcluded) \\ - Not Relevant (n = \notRelevant) \\ - Not Open/Available paper (n = \notOpenAvailable)}{};

% Inclusion Phase

\section{Instructions}
1. \textbf{To update the numbers}, change the values in the \textbf{Variables Section} at the beginning of the document.
2. \textbf{Recompile the document} in Overleaf, and the diagram will automatically update.
3. \textbf{Ensure the PRISMA package is installed}

\section{Conclusion}
This template simplifies the creation of PRISMA flow diagrams in Overleaf. It ensures \textbf{consistency and ease of updating} for systematic reviews.
